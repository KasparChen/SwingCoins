# SwingCoins

Memecoins have become a staple of crypto culture, where anyone can join and trade on equal footing. However, while assets remain central to crypto, the trading experience has barely evolved.

## Current Challenges:

Despite its success, the original (3,3) model doesn't actually fully align with the spirit of crypto—"Don’t trust, verify." It requires faith in collective profit maximization, which can backfire dramatically, as seen in almost every 3,3 projects, even like the OHM.

The ve(3,3) system introduces a way to optimize the model through the staking and bribe mechanism. However, while it provides a more stable fluctuation, it also compresses the potential profit, making it less appealing to long-tail, small-scale users, who are actually the majority in the memecoin market.

These users are well aware of the PvP nature of memecoins, but the market tends to obscure this reality with narratives of community and culture. Our solution? Embrace and amplify the truth.

## Our Solution:

We’ve created a mechanism that brings real PvP dynamics to memecoins under the ve(3,3) framework. Here’s the basic idea:

- **Staking = Attacking**

Staking and voting are critical behaviors in our design for attacking other tokens(we will launch a pair of tokens), which will directly impact their prices.

Let's say the two tokens are named A and B. When users stake token A, it burns a certain amount of A while minting the same amount of B.

This action pumps the price of A while dumping the price of B. (The actual process is more complicated than this, involving the interoperation with LP)

- **Voting = ULT (Ultimate Skill)**

After each voting period, the emission ratio of $THE will adjust based on the voting in THENA, which will also become a critical multiple of the price change in the next epoch.

So, more votes = higher emission = more staking + more voting rewards + less dump + greater pump.

## Other Design

- From the People To the People
There will be a 3% sell tax, and 50% of the trading fee income will automatically be allocated to a charity wallet. All staking holders will decide which charities it will go to.
- Crypto Native Distribution:

> 50% of the initial token will pair with BNB, and the LP will be burnt.
> 50% of initial tokens will be airdropped to specify token holders like THE holders.

## Conclusion

This model improves from the ve(3,3), giving users not only the APR but also returning the excitement on price speculation. Various strategies provide the implementation of the real game theory.

In addition, the unique part that highlights it from other memecoin is the **Sustainable Cycle**; the token pair is like a seesaw; there’s always a chance to buy low, push the price back up, and capitalize on the movement.

**That's what we made -- the SwingCoins.**

## **Features**

- **Staking as Attack**: Users can stake one token to attack another, burning the staked token while minting the counterpart, causing real-time price shifts.
- **Voting Impact**: veTHE holders vote on liquidity pools, influencing the emission ratios of THE and, by extension, the game’s dynamics.
- **Dual-Token System**: Two tokens, A and B, compete in a PvP scenario where staking directly affects market conditions.
- **Charity Integration**: A percentage of every transaction is allocated to a charity wallet, with recipients chosen by community vote.
- **Sustainable Volatility**: The system is designed to maintain the high volatility that memecoin traders seek, while ensuring market swings are strategic and rewarding.
